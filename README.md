## Description

Learn how to share the updates of your software with collaborators, users and other stakeholders in a clear and understandable way. Automate the process of writing the project history following the industry standards and best practices.

In this workshop we will:

- discuss various approaches to versioning
- deep-dive into Semantic Versioning, by far the most popular versioning scheme nowadays
- talk about different sources of truth about the history of a project
- define what a changelog is and where we can store it to make it accessible for everyone
- learn how to maintain parallel flows of versioning within a project
- write some ahead of the curve functional code featuring monoids, mjs and tagged templates
- build from scratch a dependency-free versioning tool in Node that is capable of deducing the next version to come up and creating changelogs
